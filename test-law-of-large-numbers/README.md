Testing the Law of Large Numbers with a simple Python script: given the standard normal distribution (with the mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1), count how many of these numbers fall between -1 and 1 (non-inclusive) and calculate the percentage of these numbers against the total of the numbers generated.

The script allows the user to enter the number of trials N and tests how many of them are between -1 and 1, then calculates the percentage of numbers within this range to demonstrate that as more trials are performed, the probability of a randomly generated number to be between -1 and 1 is approaching 68.2%.
